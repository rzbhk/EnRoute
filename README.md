This is the public repository for codes and related material for our framework En Route:
R. Ketabi, B. Alipour and A. Helmy, "En route: Towards vehicular mobility scenario generation at scale," 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), Atlanta, GA, 2017

The purpose of this framework is to generate scenarios from measurements data which can be used for further urban scale studies.
